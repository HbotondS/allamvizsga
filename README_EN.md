# Online image visualization with large image collections

### Goal
Display large image collections (collected from Twitter) and display them in the browser.

### Used techologies
The server was written in the Django framework, and for the image processing part we used OpenCV.
For the clinet side we used P5.js which was very helpfull during the development and was really easy to use.
